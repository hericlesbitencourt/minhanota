# Minha Nota

This is a mobile application developed in React Native, which aims to assist university students in calculating the necessary grades to pass in a given subject.

## Features

The user enters their grades for the first two evaluations and AV3 and/or AV4. Based on this data, the application calculates the necessary grade in the 3rd or 4th evaluation and in the final evaluation for the student to pass the subject. While the calculation is being done, an animation is displayed on the screen, with positive, negative or neutral feedback.

## Lessons

JavaScript has some limitations in the Math.round() function, where it is not possible to specify the rounding precision of decimal places. In addition, some floating-point calculations in JavaScript can cause rounding errors. However, it was possible to create a custom function that uses simple arithmetic to round a number to a certain number of decimal places.

## Conclusion

The application is free, non-profit, and does not collect users' personal data.

Please note that although we have done our best to test and ensure that the application works correctly, there may be problems on some devices. If you encounter any errors, please open an issue.

We appreciate if you share and promote the application with your friends and positively evaluate it on the PlayStore.
